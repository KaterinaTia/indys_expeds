					<h2>EXPEDITIONS</h2>
					<p>Every expedition is led by one team leader and one assistant. Excluding those, we accept up to 12 expedition members.  Expeditions are generally 10 to 14 days long, each trip starts with one day induction. Pricing is variable depending on the trip and will be enclosed together with a trip brief when you register your interest in joining the expedition.</p><br>
					<p id="secondpar">During the induction, the team leader outlines agenda and objectives of the trip. Included is also introduction and background of the place / artefact which is subject of the expedition. The last part of induction consists of introduction to possible dangerous situations which you can face during the expedition, and a basic survival training. This part of induction also works as a team building exercise.</p>

					<h3>SECRET TOMB OF EMPEROR TU DUC</h3>
					<h4>TEAM LEADER:<span class="red"> Lara Croft</span> | DATE:<span class="red"> 17-28 March</span></h4>
					<p>Vietnamese emperor Tu Duc of the Nguyen dynasty held the reign from 1848 to 1883. As he had no children there was nobody he could pass his wealth down to. He decided to build a large tomb along with majestic temple buildings. After the tomb was built it was often used by Tu Duc and his wives for retreat. Tu Duc was worried that after his death the tomb will be raided by thieves, so he decided that his remains and fortune will be carried and buried in a secret location… And we are going to find it!</p>
